If you know how to issue a pull request, that would be great. Add your modules as described below.
Test to make sure your modifications are working and send the pull request to the repo.

Otherwise, continue with these instructions.

1. You can ask me and I'll do it for you, especially if you are not comfortable making code modifications.

2. Again, you can ask me and I'll gladly do it for you.

3. You want to do it yourself? Alrighty then! You'll still have to tell me so I can add it to the repo.

4. Open the sentences.json file in a code editor

You'll see that most of the commands come in pairs.
The easiest way to add your commands would be to copy a pair of HIDE and SHOW commmands.
That's two complete lines including the comma.
Example:

"HIDE ALARM",
"SHOW ALARM",

Now paste it in between an existing pair and the next existing pair. Alphabetically would be nice. :-)
Example:

"HIDE CARDS",
"SHOW CARDS",
"HIDE ALARM",
"SHOW ALARM",
"HIDE CENSUS",
"SHOW CENSUS",

Now edit the one you pasted with the command of your choice so it looks like this.
In this example "CATERING" would be your command.

"HIDE CARDS",
"SHOW CARDS",
"HIDE CATERING",
"SHOW CATERING",
"HIDE CENSUS",
"SHOW CENSUS",

Save the sentences.json file and close.



5. Open the checkCommands.json file in a code editor to avoid syntax problems. (known quote issue)

Copy lines 4 and 5 entirely, including the commas. These are your template for adding your module to the array.
Paste on line 6. Create a blank line above and below your pasted line.

You now see this on lines 7 and 8. You'll only be changing "COMMAND" (twice) and "MMM-ModuleName" (twice).

["SHOW","COMMAND","","","true","MMM-ModuleName",""],
["HIDE","COMMAND","","","false","MMM-ModuleName",""],
         ^^^^^^^                 ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

1. Now change "COMMAND" in both lines to the command word you would like to use.
   It MUST be in double quotes and it MUST be CAPITALS. See example.


2. Now change "MMM-ModuleName" in both lines to the EXACT module name you would like to use.
   Module name MUST be in double quotes. Module names are case sensitive.

Save and close.


You've just added a module for use with Hello-Lucy OR you fucked up. ;-)


6. You should have let me do it for you. :-)

7. Tell me the command and module name and I will add it to the repo. Thanks!



## Important!

When adding to the checkCommands.json file. The last array in the file CANNOT have a comma after it
